# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

[**NOTE AND ANSWER:**]{.underline}

We have 1004 missing values in weight. The lowest weight is 30kgs and highest weight is 181 kgs. The mean weight of the class is 68kgs and median weight is 64kgs. We can see that Q3 is 76kgs. That means 75% of the weights are between 30kgs and 76kgs. As per the histogram, it's clear that the remaining 25% of the data is really spread between 76kgs and 181kgs. This is evident in the skewness of the graph. It is right skewed and mean is larger than the median. It gives us an indication that there are some outliers that have increased the value of the mean.

```{r, eda_on_weight}
#Understanding the data
skimr::skim(yrbss)

yrbss%>%
  summarise(count_na_weight = sum(is.na(weight)))
# 1004 observations with missing weight

summary(yrbss)

#Plotting histogram of weight
yrbss %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight))+
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Distribution of Weights", y="Number of participants", x="Weight"
  )

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler's weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let's create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. Use the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

```{r, mutate_and_count}

#Adding a new column to represent those who do physical activity for atleast 3 days a week
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
    mutate( physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >=3, "Yes","No"))

yrbss
  
#Counting number of yes and no using groupby and summarise
count_yesorno <- yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarize(count_physical_3plus = n())%>%
  mutate(percentage = count_physical_3plus / sum(count_physical_3plus), percentage = parse_number(scales::percent(percentage)))

count_yesorno
  
#counting using count function
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  count(physical_3plus)

```

Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

**NOTE:**

We are 95% confident that the proportion of participants that are not active for 3 or more days is within the lower bound of 0.3229 and the upper bound 0.3389.

Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

We observe that there is a small positive relationship between weight and the amount of days physically active within a week. However, the difference in distribution is only minor. We conducted a small sanity check by means of calculating means and creating a best fit line plot. This confirmed that in fact the relationship between weight and physical activity is indeed small.

These findings are rather surprising! The intuition of our group was that people that are more physically active would weigh less. However, on second thought, there might be many other factors contributing to to the weight of a person apart from physical activity (e.g. diet, age, ect.). Physically active people might burn more calories, tough gain muscle weight.

```{r, boxplot}

#confidence interval calculation for a binomial
# we would like to get the SE by using the formula SE = srt(p(1-p)/n)
# obtain the n
n = count_yesorno[1,2]+count_yesorno[2,2]
n <- n$count_physical_3plus

#calculate the proportion of population that works out less than 3 days a week
p_hat <- count_yesorno[1,2]/(count_yesorno[1,2]+count_yesorno[2,2])
p_hat <- p_hat$count_physical_3plus

#calculate the standard error
SE_proportion <- sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n)

#calculate the confidence interval
t_critical = qt(0.975, n - 1 )
lower_bound <- p_hat - t_critical*SE_proportion
higher_bound <- p_hat + t_critical*SE_proportion

#Plotting boxplot of weight and physical activity atleast 3 days
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=physical_3plus, y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
  title = "Boxplot of weight vs physical activity", x="Phsyical activity atleast 3 days", y = "Weight"
  )

#as a small sanity check we check the age statistics and calculate a few metrics
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus, weight, age) %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(weight),
            median = median(weight),
            mean_age = mean(age),
            median_age = median(age)
            )
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=physically_active_7d, y=weight))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_lm() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
  title = "Lineplot of weight vs physical activity", x="Phsyical activity in 7 days", y = "Weight"
  )

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r, ci_using_formulas}
#confidence interval calculation for the physically


```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don't.

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```

Let x_bar_yes be the mean of students who exercise atleast 3 times a week. Let x_bar_no be the mean of students who exercise less than 3 times a week. We will define our null hypothesis as x_bar_yes - x_bar_no = 0. If the null hypothesis is true, it would signify that weight does not depend on exercise. Our alternative hypothesis would be that x_bar_yes != x_bar no. This would mean there is a relation between weight and exercise.

## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))
  
```

Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap.

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I`

```{r plot}

# To get the cleaned data
# We did not clean duplicate titles (this results in a plot that is same as what is shown above)
movies_cleaned <- movies %>%
   drop_na(rating) 

# Define list with directors of interest
moviedirectors <- c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")

filteredmovies <- movies_cleaned %>%
  filter(director %in% moviedirectors) %>%
  group_by(director) %>% 
    summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
              sd_rating = sd(rating),
              count = n(),
              t_critical = qt(0.95,count - 1),
              se_rating = sd_rating / sqrt(count),
              margin_of_error = t_critical*se_rating, 
              rating_low = mean_rating-margin_of_error,
              rating_high = mean_rating+margin_of_error,
              director = first(director), n = n()
            )

#to plot
ggplot(filteredmovies, aes(x = mean_rating, y = director, color = director)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, show.legend = FALSE)+
  geom_errorbarh(aes(y = director,xmin = rating_low, xmax = rating_high, color = director), height = 0.2, size = 1, show.legend = FALSE)+

  theme(title = element_text(size = 8))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")



#There are 2 problems
#1)I do not know how to add labels of value to the point I drew(including the points of confidence Interval)
#2) I don't know how to let Steven's ratings to be located above
```

```{r t_test}
library(infer)
directorlist <- c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")

# Direct t-test
movies_cleaned %>%

# Create obs_diff statistic
movies_obs_diff <- movies_cleaned %>%
  filter(director %in% directorlist) %>% 
  drop_na(rating) %>%

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.

## Loading the data

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega` contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion

. Confidence intervals . Hypothesis testing . Correlation analysis . Regression

Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval


```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 


# hypothesis testing using infer package


```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}


```

## Check correlations between the data

You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

# Challenge 1: Brexit plot

Using your data manipulation and visualisation skills, please use the Brexit results dataframe (the same dataset you used in the pre-programme assignement) and produce the following plot. Use the correct colour for each party; google "UK Political Party Web Colours" and find the appropriate hex code for colours, not the default colours that R gives you.

```{r brexit_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "brexit.png"), error = FALSE)

#load the data into R
brexit_results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/master/data/brexit_results.csv")

#gain a first understanding of the dataframe
glimpse(brexit_results)
skim(brexit_results)

#we want to have an overview of how the percentage of the party affilitation is related to the percentage in the brexit voting share. Therefore, we want to create a long table that displays the voting percentage per parliament constituency

#only select the most important information
brexit_results_plot_df <- brexit_results %>% 
  select(-c(born_in_uk, male, unemployed, degree, age_18to24)) %>% 
  #create a longer format dataset
  rename (Conservative = con_2015,
          Labour = lab_2015,
          "Lib Dems" = ld_2015,
          UKIP = ukip_2015) %>% 
   pivot_longer(cols = 2:5,
               names_to = "Party",
               values_to = "Party_share")

ggplot(data = brexit_results_plot_df, aes(x = Party_share, y = leave_share, colour = Party)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) + 
  geom_lm(interval = "confidence") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#0087DC", "#E4003B", "#FAA61A", "#6D3177"), name="") +
  ylim(0,100) +
  labs(title = "How political affiliation traanslated to Brexit Voting", 
       y = "Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referendum",
       x = "Party % in the UK 2015 general election") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.position = "bottom")

```

[**NOTE:**]{.underline}

The plot shows several interesting patterns. Generalizing conclusions should made cautiously which is why especially the relationship of the parliament constituencies' share of votes for the labour and/or conservative party and the corresponding leave share votes should not be over interpreted. However, the stronger trends for the Liberal Democrats as well as the Independent Party may show some interesting tendencies. While parliament constituencies in which the vote share for the Liberal Democrats was relatively low showed above 50% vote shares for Brexit, this vote share quickly depletes as the share of Liberal Democrats affiliation increases. An inverse relation with stronger magnitude is to be observed for the UKIP. In underrepresented parliament constituencies the vote share to leave the EU was relatively low but strongly increases as the affiliation to the UKIP grows. At around 20% representation of the UKIP in the parliament constituencies the vote shares were up to 75%. This finding should not come as a suprise, as the main campaign positions of the UKIP was to be independent of the EU whereas the Liberal Democrats campaigned to stay.

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

# Create long form data
tidy_GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  mutate(Shortind = gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",as.character(IndicatorName))) %>% #Remove all characters after "(", inclusive
  mutate(Ind_id = gsub("\\b(\\pL)\\pL{2,}|.", "\\U\\1", as.character(Shortind), perl = TRUE)) %>% #Remove all characters after first letter of each word
  relocate(Ind_id, .after = Shortind) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(CountryID, Country, IndicatorName, Shortind, Ind_id), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Values") %>% 
  mutate(Values = Values / 1e9) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

# Check that length of unique indicators list matches that of unique short indicators list
indicators <- unique(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName)
shortindicators <- unique(tidy_GDP_data$Shortind)
ind_id <- unique(tidy_GDP_data$Ind_id)

# Create Ind_id to IndicatorName reference table
Indicators_table <- as.data.frame(cbind(ind_id, indicators))

# Check for obserevations with NA values
tidy_GDP_data %>%
  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.))) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))

# Cursory glance

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

[**NOTE:**]{.underline}

As the graphs show, there is a small, but undeniable difference between the sum of all GDP components and the UN reported total GDP value. This might be surprising at first, but as clarified earlier, the calculation of the GDP as the sum of government spending, consumption, investments plus the net exports is rather of a simplistic nature. Simultaneously, it is very difficult to estimate the exact values for each individual component of GDP. We believe that in order to calculate the various components, the UN might have used adjusted values for a better estimate. Similarly, to not be effected by the many assumptions made to calculate the individual components, the UN might have opted to extrapolate the GDP total value based on a different, more rigorous approach.

The graphs do hint at another anomaly. There is a clear difference between the countries in terms of the accuracy of the sum of GDP's components and the UN's reported GDP value. Whilst it seems as if the values for Germany and the United Stated have aligned with the reported GDP amount, the GDP estimate for India remains different until the present day. This might be down to the relatively high quality of data for Germany's and the USA's economy as opposed to the data on India's economy. Therefore, the UN might have been forced to fall back on assumptions and estimations that lead to less accurate representations of the true values.

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?

These graphs depict some noteworthy differences, similarities and trends. For all three countries, though very different, there is a strong tendency for the trade balance/ net exports to play a small part in the the countries GDP share. However, this does not imply that there are not significant differences in the magnitude of the im- and exports between these countries. Though, it does hint at the fact that despite all three countries having a strong industry (India's natural resources and tech sector, Germany's automobile and chemical industry and USA's oil and automobile sector) all strongly depend on foreign goods to cover their domestic demand. Therefore the net exports' GDP share are almost negligible. Only Germany, who has been up-scaling their exporting of automobiles to eastern countries and especially China has been realizing a positively developing share of net exports.

In the meantime, household spending makes up the largest share of GDP for all countries around the 60% mark. While Germany and the USA have been steady in this area for the last few decades, India has realized a 15% drop in its share. This might be down to an increasing share of household finances being used to spend on foreign goods as the middle class in India grows. Another explanation might be that through the relatively stronger increase in other components of the GDP the household expenditures' share decreases a result.

The investments in India are an exemplary increase that might have caused the share of household expenditures to decrease. India's size and resources make it an interesting trade partner for many other global powers and throughout the last 20 years India has felt an increasing investment in its country. This is observable in especially its tech sector and infrastructure. The growth of companies such as SPAN Infotech and Tata as well foreign investment by China through its silk road initiative are driving forces in this trend.

The government expenditure on the other hand is relatively low in India. USA and Germany have witnessed around 10% higher government expenditure relative to their GDP, as they have more established governmental structures and tax systems as well as social benefit systems that allow as well as require for higher relative government expenditure, respectively.

The countries above have been chosen based on some of the nationalities of our group members.

The first observation is that the differences between the Netherlands and Germany are close to non-existent. Not only are the components' shares similar, but the tends over the last 50 years are remarkably close: The share of net exports have been steadily increasing from around 0% to 10%, the government expenditure and gross capital formation have been around the 20 % mark and household expenditures have been steadily decreasing. This is where the only notable difference between the two countries lies and as the share of GDP based on household expenditures has been consistently 5-10 percentage points lower in the Dutch as opposed to the German economy.

The share distribution of the components for China are very much different to what could be observed for the two western European countries. The largest differences are in the share of government expenditure, gross capital formation and household expenditure. While the level of government expenditure is consistently lower than for its European counterparts, China's GDP share of investment and household expenditure seem to have traded shares over the last 5 decades with investments on the rise especially in the last 20 years and the GDP share of household expenditures almost falling 20 percentage points. It is no groundbreaking finding, that China's level of investments, both domestic and international has skyrocketed in the last 20 years, but the magnitude is astonishing. Especially considering the ever growing wealth and middle class in China would hint at the fact that household expenditures should increase tremendously. Yet still, investments in China strongly out way this trend as China has grown to be a country with among the fastest growing infrastructure and conglomerates.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
